This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.11.

# Important
The Api key is in the code, because it's important that test testers only install the dependencies and start the service.
If you need a guide with this repository or want to know how it is implemented, when copying the code you must change the API key for yours

## Development server
```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run dev server
$ ng serve -o
```
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
